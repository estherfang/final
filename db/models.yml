# As a buyer, I want to post a task and a price that I will pay someone for doing it.
# e.g. Pick up my laundry on Thursday 5/15 between 9am and 5pm from Location A
# and drop it off at location B.

# As a seller, I want to search available tasks by location and accept tasks that I
# am willing to do for the given price.

# If the task has not been accepted by a seller, then "seller_id" will be blank.
# "address" will be converted into coordinates for displaying on a map and
# searching by sellers.

# Assume that buyers pay sellers in cash upon completion of task.
